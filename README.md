# COMP 472 (Artificial Intelligence) - Project 2

## **Deliverable 1 Milestones**

### **Experiments completed**

- [x] (Experiment 1) The required model with V=0 n=1 d=0
- [x] (Experiment 2) The required model with V=1 n=2 d=0.5
- [x] (Experiment 3) The required model with V=1 n=3 d=1
- [x] (Experiment 4) The required model with V=2 n=2 d=0.3
- [ ] The BYOM

Note, due to time and mostly due to the fact that I and my father had contracted COVID-19 like symptoms in the last week and a half, I did not have enough time to experiment early on and just barely was able to complete the required fundamentals of this project.

## **Running the program**

Very simply, I've once again relied on `Makefile` to help me out with the task of automating. 

To simply run the program (with defaults set for the parameters), type `make all`.

To run any one of the *required* models, simply type `make experiment#` where `#` is a number from 1 through 4 (see the Experiments completed section above for which is which). E.g. `make experiment1`
